  # CVE-2025-45769: firebase/php-jwt weak encryption (DISPUTED)
  # Status: DISPUTED by MITRE - tagged as "disputed" under CNA review
  # 
  # Reason for ignoring:
  # 1. DISPUTED CVE - Issue contested by maintainers and under review
  # 2. Not a library bug - Key lengths are application responsibility 
  # 3. Our implementation uses ES256 (ECDSA) with P-256 curves (256-bit keys)
  # 4. Not affected by HMAC/RSA key length issues mentioned in CVE
  # 5. Keys are controlled by trusted GOV.UK service and generated to sufficient quality
  # 6. Keys used by DVSA to sign our JWTs are also of sufficient cryptographic quality
  # 7. No fixed version available (and may not be needed)
  #
  # Risk Assessment: LOW
  # - Vulnerability is disputed and may be invalid
  # - Our specific use case (ES256/ECDSA) is not affected
  # - Keys are from trusted government sources with proper cryptographic standards
  #
  # Monitoring: Will review when dispute is resolved or fix is available
  # Last reviewed: 2025-10-10
